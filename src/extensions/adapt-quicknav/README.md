Navigation bar that is positioned within the page, typically at the bottom. Can be configured to contain any of the following buttons:
- home (takes you back to top level menu)
- up (takes you to the menu the next level up in the hierarchy)
- previous (navigates directly to the previous page, if exists, without having to navigate via the menu)
- next (navigates directly to the next page, if exists, without having to navigate via the menu)

You can lock the next button until certain criteria are met by the user - see example.json for how to do this.

Additionally, quicknav buttons can now be configured to use icons instead of text - see example.json for how to do this.
